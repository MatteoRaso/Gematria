# Study Gematria from the command line

## What's a Gematria?
A Gematria is a type of Jewish numerology where letters are converted into numbers and added together, with the final number supposingly revealing some esoteric meaning.

## How do I use this program?

Typing in `python gematria.py -h` brings up all the commands.

`python gematria.py -c foo` gets the gematria of "foo"

`python gematria.py -d` generates a dictionary of words and their gematria.

`python gematria.py -dc` does the same as the above command, but without swears.

`python gematria.py -w integer` gets every word with the integer as its gematria. The user may optionally write `python gematria.py -w integer True` to include swear words.

`python gematria.py -s integer` gets every sentence with the integer as its gematria (you have to extract [sentences.tar.gz](https://mega.nz/file/BTZzwAbS#7X2u3AnQtap_TNCPetIqJ6zlF_k771izdt2v_jU5Lvs) first)
